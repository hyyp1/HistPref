Unlike traditional databases controlled by a single entity, blockchain is distributed, making it more secure and resistant to tampering. Each block in the chain contains a list of transactions and is linked to the previous block using cryptographic hashes.

Each block contains a number of transactions.\n2. **Decentralization**: Unlike traditional databases that are controlled by a single entity, a blockchain is distributed across a network of computers (nodes).

This is done through a consensus mechanism, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).\n4. **Immutability**: Once a block is added to the blockchain, it becomes part of a permanent record.
